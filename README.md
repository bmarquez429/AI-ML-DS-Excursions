# AI/ML/DS Excursions 
**Bernardo Marquez** ([LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/bernardo-marquez-1266476))

This repo stores notebooks that I have created in Google Colab as well as scripts that I have created locally to gather my explorations and learnings in one location and to demonstrate various concepts and algorithms in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning/Data Science. The notebooks and scripts are currently organized in folders or submodules that are listed in the order that they were created. When there are already sufficiently many notebooks and scripts in this repo, I will further create folders or submodules to organize the content by themes.

A list of the descriptions of the notebooks and scripts is available in [my GitHub Pages site](https://bmarquez429.github.io/).
