# AI/ML/DS Excursions

This repo stores notebooks that I have created in Google Colab to gather my explorations and learnings in one location and to demonstrate various concepts and algorithms in Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning/Data Science. The notebooks are currently organized in folders that are listed in the order that they were created. When there are already sufficiently many notebooks in this repo, I will further create folders to organize the notebooks by themes.

A list of the notebook descriptions is available in [my GitHub Pages site](https://bmarquez429.github.io/).
