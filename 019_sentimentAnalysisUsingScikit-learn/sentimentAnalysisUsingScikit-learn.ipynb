Something for Spielberg and Lucas to learn from. ;) A sixth-grader Kolya \\\"Nick\\\" Gerasimov finds a time machine in the basement of a decrepit building and travels 100 years into the future. He discovers a near-perfect, utopian society where robots play guitars and write poetry, everyone is kind to each other and people enjoy everything technology has to offer. Alice is the daughter of a prominent scientist who invented a device called Mielophone that allows to read minds of humans and animals. The device can be put to both good and bad use, depending on whose hands it falls into. When two evil space pirates from Saturn who want to rule the universe attempt to steal Mielophone, it falls into the hands of 20th century school boy Nick. With the pirates hot on his tracks, he travels back to his time, followed by the pirates, and Alice. Chaos, confusion and funny situations follow as the luckless pirates try to blend in with the earthlings. Alice enrolls in the same school Nick goes to and demonstrates superhuman abilities in PE class. The catch is, Alice doesn't know what Nick looks like, while the pirates do. Also, the pirates are able to change their appearance and turn literally into anyone. (Hmm, I wonder if this is where James Cameron got the idea for Terminator...) Who gets to Nick -- and Mielophone -- first? Excellent plot, non-stop adventures, and great soundtrack. I wish Hollywood made kid movies like this one...\",\n          \"\\\"National Treasure\\\" (2004) is a thoroughly misguided hodge-podge of plot entanglements that borrow from nearly every cloak and dagger government conspiracy clich\\u00e9 that has ever been written. The film stars Nicholas Cage as Benjamin Franklin Gates (how precious is that, I ask you?); a seemingly normal fellow who, for no other reason than being of a lineage of like-minded misguided fortune hunters, decides to steal a 'national treasure' that has been hidden by the United States founding fathers. After a bit of subtext and background that plays laughably (unintentionally) like Indiana Jones meets The Patriot, the film degenerates into one misguided whimsy after another \\u0096 attempting to create a 'Stanley Goodspeed' regurgitation of Nicholas Cage and launch the whole convoluted mess forward with a series of high octane, but disconnected misadventures.<br /><br />The relevancy and logic to having George Washington and his motley crew of patriots burying a king's ransom someplace on native soil, and then, going through the meticulous plan of leaving clues scattered throughout U.S. currency art work, is something that director Jon Turteltaub never quite gets around to explaining. Couldn't Washington found better usage for such wealth during the start up of the country? Hence, we are left with a mystery built on top of an enigma that is already on shaky ground by the time Ben appoints himself the new custodian of this untold wealth. Ben's intentions are noble \\u0096 if confusing. He's set on protecting the treasure. For who and when?\\u0085your guess is as good as mine.<br /><br />But there are a few problems with Ben's crusade. First up, his friend, Ian Holmes (Sean Bean) decides that he can't wait for Ben to make up his mind about stealing the Declaration of Independence from the National Archives (oh, yeah \\u0096 brilliant idea!). Presumably, the back of that famous document holds the secret answer to the ultimate fortune. So Ian tries to kill Ben. The assassination attempt is, of course, unsuccessful, if overly melodramatic. It also affords Ben the opportunity to pick up, and pick on, the very sultry curator of the archives, Abigail Chase (Diane Kruger). She thinks Ben is clearly a nut \\u0096 at least at the beginning. But true to action/romance form, Abby's resolve melts quicker than you can say, \\\"is that the Hope Diamond?\\\" The film moves into full X-File-ish mode, as the FBI, mistakenly believing that Ben is behind the theft, retaliate in various benign ways that lead to a multi-layering of action sequences reminiscent of Mission Impossible meets The Fugitive. Honestly, don't those guys ever get 'intelligence' information that is correct? In the final analysis, \\\"National Treasure\\\" isn't great film making, so much as it's a patchwork rehash of tired old bits from other movies, woven together from scraps, the likes of which would make IL' Betsy Ross blush.<br /><br />The Buena Vista DVD delivers a far more generous treatment than this film is deserving of. The anamorphic widescreen picture exhibits a very smooth and finely detailed image with very rich colors, natural flesh tones, solid blacks and clean whites. The stylized image is also free of blemishes and digital enhancements. The audio is 5.1 and delivers a nice sonic boom to your side and rear speakers with intensity and realism. Extras include a host of promotional junket material that is rather deep and over the top in its explanation of how and why this film was made. If only, as an audience, we had had more clarification as to why Ben and co. were chasing after an illusive treasure, this might have been one good flick. Extras conclude with the theatrical trailer, audio commentary and deleted scenes.

Robert DeNiro plays a Dumb Hollywood version of the standard<br /><br />violence prone tough cop (i.e., he beats up the bad guys and rolls his<br /><br />eyes at cops who prefer to stick by the book), and Eddie Murphy plays a<br /><br />not so tough cop who would rather be an actor (i.e., he screams out,<br /><br />\\\"Freeze, police!\\\" and has his \\\"tough look\\\" down pat). Naturally, they<br /><br />are partnered when Bobby's loose cannon tactics get him in hot water<br /><br />with the media and he is essentially blackmailed into starring in a<br /><br />\\\"Cops\\\"-like reality show. Take a breath, cuz that's as funny as it<br /><br />gets.<br /><br />No energy was put into the script - it feels like a pale retread of<br /><br />every copy buddy movie tossed into a blender with \\\"15 Minutes\\\" starring,<br /><br />yes, DeNiro himself as, pretty much the character he is playing here. <br /><br />The jokes fall flat, the action feels listless, and no one seems to be<br /><br />having a good time. It's dead on the screen.<br /><br />Please don't waste your time. Even if you have an overwheming affinity<br /><br />for one of the actors - avoid it and do them a favor. Becauze if this<br /><br />makes money, these kinda of scripts will be deeemed perfectly acceptable<br /><br />for actors of their quality.<br /><br />And to Mr. DeNiro. You used to make serious films. I remember them -<br /><br />they were good. You were nominated for awards for them - remember how<br /><br />much fun that was? Now after \\\"Analyze This\\\" (which was good), \\\"Meet the<br /><br />Parents\\\" (which was also good), and \\\"The Adventures of Rocky and<br /><br />Bullwinkle\\\" (which was NOT good), I think we need to see you parodying<br /><br />yourself less, and BEING yourself more. \\\"Casino\\\" feels like a long time<br /><br />ago. And no, I don't count \\\"15 Minutes\\\" as serious Bobby. Anyone who<br /><br />took that media satire seriously must get their weekly world news\",\n          \"Just Before dawn is an excellent horror movie. It is atmospheric, filled with tension made of wonderful shots of wild nature, in which few young people meet their doom, in the shape of two crazed, fat bastards,who slaughter them. Jeff Lieberman is very talented and intelligent director,who is unfortunately underrated. He achieved to built tension, not with gore,but with showing menacing nature environment. Lieberman succeeds to built a tension in a very linear, simplistic way, which is also the best way, not to show to the viewer the gore, but to let him to imagine the worst thing that happen to characters. <br /><br />Just Before Dawn was always compared to Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Deliverance and Hills have eyes. It is as good looking as Deliverance, better than Hills, I mean scarier and better crafted,and it is creepy as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.<br /><br />JBD is one of the best horrors of past few decades, who finally lives on DVD!\",\n          \"This film is a true and historical film. It is very useful to those researching the LDS church, because it is 100% true. It is an excellent film and I recommend it.<br /><br />It is very factual, exciting, and motivational. There are some who think it is not factual, but it is.<br /><br />It is about the restoration of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and about the prophet, Joseph Smith, who restored it. It has such events in his life as the disease that he had when he was a small boy, his courting Emma Smith, Emma, his wife, giving birth, and so on.

The attempts at humor are generic to a degree where even contemporary television comedy trumps it, and considering that this is supposed to be comedy, I doubt I need to say more.<br /><br />This is not to be seen for its qualities, for it has none, but for it's failings and again, how Hollywood is spilling it's life's blood of the past in the pursuit of a quick buck.<br /><br />I think I'll watch the original before the upcoming Christmas season just to try to regain my childhood innocence, from a lost time when motion pictures were more than just high-budget, but mindless, garbage.\",\n          \"Reading some of the comments on the message boards here I was expecting this movie to be a complete letdown - but when I watched it I could not stop laughing! It has officially become my new favourite movie.<br /><br />I don't know what all the hate here is about, maybe it's because a movie of this kind has never really been around before. I am at a loss to name another completely female driven comedy. Plenty of comedies will have one or two actresses in the lead, but there will be a lot of supporting male characters. This one was almost ALL women - with the exception of Seth Meyers, Justin Hartley and the brief appearance of Will Arnett - and it worked. All of the actresses delivered very funny performances (especially Missi Pyle) from a quirky and lovable script.<br /><br />The charm of this film, to me, seems to be in its subtle feminist message: accepting who you are, female success in the public sphere, the strength of female friendships and breaking gender roles. Light-hearted though it is, each of the lead characters face a challenge as their attempts to be more 'fun' conflict with their feminist values and who they knew themselves to be.<br /><br />Missi Pyle proposed that this film missed a theatrical release because of its all-female cast and lack of a big-name actor to get the studios behind it, and I have to agree. Everyone I've recommended this film to has loved it and I think it's a shame that a comedy celebrating female dorkiness hasn't been widely accepted and successful.<br /><br />I highly recommend this film to anyone with an open mind or a love of female-centred comedy.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"sentiment\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"positive\",\n          \"negative\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}],"source":["testSet = pd.concat([xTest, yTest], axis = 1)\n","testSet.head()"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"pa2WlMWcqevP"},"source":["##### Extract features from the reviews in the training and test sets using TF-IDF."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"r01u-h4Nqqld"},"outputs":[],"source":["xTrain = xTrain.review.values\n","xTest = xTest.review.values\n","yTrain = yTrain.sentiment.values\n","yTest = yTest.sentiment.values\n","\n","vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()\n","trainVectors = vectorizer.fit_transform(xTrain)\n","testVectors = vectorizer.transform(xTest)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##### List the classifiers to be trained."],"metadata":{"id":"1UKMagWaR3_Y"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"YxajkGEvhe51"},"outputs":[],"source":["classifiers = [(\"Decision Tree Classifier\", DecisionTreeClassifier(random_state = 1)),\n","               (\"k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier\", KNeighborsClassifier()),\n","               (\"Logistic Regression\", LogisticRegression(random_state = 1)),\n","               (\"Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier\", MultinomialNB()),\n","               (\"Random Forest Classifier\", RandomForestClassifier(random_state = 1)),\n","               (\"Support Vector Classifier\", SVC(random_state = 1))]"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##### Train and test each classifier."],"metadata":{"id":"8omCK9wTSC5c"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lHa4DJFSheyg","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"outputId":"eb9fd700-c8d6-4c64-c315-c38ae78121f4","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1730854050395,"user_tz":-480,"elapsed":4602857,"user":{"displayName":"Bernardo Marquez","userId":"09066232287257036974"}}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\n"," Training and testing a Decision Tree Classifier ...
